# GraphPU

"GraphPU" is a 3D GPU graph visualization application. We have developed a rendering framework and
HPC algorithms based on Rust and WebGPU, allowing the application to simulate and render millions of nodes and
edges in real-time on Vulkan and Metal platforms. The demo contains multiple large-scale graph datasets
including movie semantics, emails, large website structures, personal WeChat relationships, and social media
connections. The audience can interact with these data through a controller knob, experiencing social physics
and complex networks in a particle universe.
